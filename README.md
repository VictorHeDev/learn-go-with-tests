# learn-go-with-tests

Use the [Learn Go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) resource to learn Go locally. It goes over basic syntax and exercises to help new Gophers.

I created this repo for my own use, but if you want to run it for whatever reason you will need to [install Golang](https://go.dev/dl/). 

I primarily use a desktop at home runing Fedora workstation so I installed Golang using `dnf install go`.
